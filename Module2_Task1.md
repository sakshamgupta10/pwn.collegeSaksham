# Challenge Name: The Root
In this challenge we see that the filesystem starts at / and under this there are a lot of other directories,configuration files,programs and most importantly flags.
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{k3mWYsbt1h8qvZ-JFCcXiQ1obSw.QX4cTO0wiN0AzNzEzW}'
```bash
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{k3mWYsbt1h8qvZ-JFCcXiQ1obSw.QX4cTO0wiN0AzNzEzW}
hacker@paths~the-root:~$
```

I showed my solve before.
My thought process: I understood that filesystems start at / and we used /pwn to get the flag. I invoked the program by providing its path on the command line and then wrote /pwn and got my flag.
## What I learned
I learned that the filesystem starts at / and under this there are a lot of other directories,configuration files,programs and most importantly flags. I also learnt that after we type /pwn we get a flag.
