# Challenge Name: Program and absolute paths
In this challenge we explore a more complicated path. We see the use of challenge directory.

## My solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{AOjFUEe8bn-mo9-IabU8n-U0QsL.QX1QTN0wiN0AzNzEzW}'
```bash
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{AOjFUEe8bn-mo9-IabU8n-U0QsL.QX1QTN0wiN0AzNzEzW}
```

I showed my solve before.
My thought process: I understood the use of challenge directory and that the path to run the challenge program is /challenge/run.
## What I learned
I learned how to use the challenge directory and how to run it.
