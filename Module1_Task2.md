# Challenge Name: Intro to Arguements 
In this challenge we invoke commands with arguements, which is basically additional data passed to the command. We use the echo command.

## My solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{4C9p8gmgg_5nKYqesHTKcVzy6vy.QX4YjM1wiN0AzNzEzW}'
```bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ echo Hello Hackers!
Hello Hackers!
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4C9p8gmgg_5nKYqesHTKcVzy6vy.QX4YjM1wiN0AzNzEzW}
```

I showed my solve before.
My thought process: I understood the use of arguements and how they help us by giving us additional data. The echo command prints the arguement we wrote after it. To get a flag we must run the hello command.
## What I learned
I learned the use of arguements and how to use it with commands. We see the use of echo command and arguements. I also learnt what happens when we use the hello command with arguement of hackers.
