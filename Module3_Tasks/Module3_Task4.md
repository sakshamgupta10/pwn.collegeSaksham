# Challenge Name: grepping for a needle in a haystack
In this challenge we will learn how to use grep command to search for contents we need if files get too big.
## My solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{csTF2iX2SVrnGnsHluRm3rByuXJ.QX3EDO0wiN0AzNzEzW}'
```bash
hacker@commands~grepping-for-a-needle-in-a-haystack:~$ grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt
pwn.college{csTF2iX2SVrnGnsHluRm3rByuXJ.QX3EDO0wiN0AzNzEzW}
```

I showed my solve before.
My thought process: I got familiar with the grep command. It was interesting to see how in such a big file using grep command we could make searching so much easier.

## What I learned
I learnt that we can use the grep command to make searching easier in files that are too big.
