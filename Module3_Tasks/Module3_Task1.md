# Challenge Name: cat: not the pet, but the command!
In this challenge we will learn how to use the cat command which is used for reading out files.
## My solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{8XzQdS7d9KxbuYdAvyCJWPE-ZKo.QXxcTN0wiN0AzNzEzW}'
```bash
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{8XzQdS7d9KxbuYdAvyCJWPE-ZKo.QXxcTN0wiN0AzNzEzW}
```

I showed my solve before.
My thought process: I understood that cat files is used for reading out files.

## What I learned
I learnt that cat is a command which is used for reading out files and it will  concatenate mutliple files if provided multiple arguements. On the other hand if we give no arguements cat will read from the terminal input and output it.
