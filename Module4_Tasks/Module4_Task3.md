# Challenge Name: Reading Manuals 
In this challenge we will learn how to use the man command (short for manual) to display the manual of a command.
## My solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{MaHnLvxNqO5Zt9Z9UmhDoczCVx-.QX0EDO0wiN0AzNzEzW}'
```bash
hacker@man~reading-manuals:~$ man challenge
hacker@man~reading-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --anvxqt 599
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{MaHnLvxNqO5Zt9Z9UmhDoczCVx-.QX0EDO0wiN0AzNzEzW}
```

I showed my solve before.
My thought process: We understand how to use the man command (short for manual) to display the manual of a command.
After we read the manual to close it we press the q command. Reading the manual gave us a hint which we used to get the flag.

## What I learned
I learnt how to use the man command to display the manual of a command. I also learnt that we press 'q' to close a manual.
