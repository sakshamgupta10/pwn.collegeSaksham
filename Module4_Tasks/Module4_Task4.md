# Challenge Name: Searching Manuals 
In this challenge we will learn how to search through a manual.
## My solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{o4DUNGxml8vTZKfXIhHyvaDyHFV.QX1EDO0wiN0AzNzEzW}'
```bash
hacker@man~searching-manuals:~$ man challenge
hacker@man~searching-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge  --krrda
Initializing...
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{o4DUNGxml8vTZKfXIhHyvaDyHFV.QX1EDO0wiN0AzNzEzW}
```

I showed my solve before.
My thought process: We understand how to search through a manual.
After searching, we can hit n to go to the next result and N to go to the previous result.  Instead of /, you can use ? to search backwards.

## What I learned
I learnt how to search through a manual and how to search efficiently.
