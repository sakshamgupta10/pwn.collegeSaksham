# Challenge Name: Multiple Globs
In this challenge we learn that bash  supports the expansion of multiple globs in a single word.
## My solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{EuenbDuguhl7pavYqlpBbom9ayk.0lM3kjNxwiN0AzNzEzW}'
```bash
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run *p*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{EuenbDuguhl7pavYqlpBbom9ayk.0lM3kjNxwiN0AzNzEzW}
```

I showed my solve before.
My thought process: We understand how to specify more than one glob at a time.
