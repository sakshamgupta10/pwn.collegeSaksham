# Challenge Name: Tab completion on commands
In this challenge we learn how tab completion is more than just files. We can also tab-complete commands.
## My solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{0GWD8Inuv-RyiJwcvKGQ3yx7ryV.0VN0EzNxwiN0AzNzEzW}'
```bash
hacker@globbing~tab-completion-on-commands:~$ pwncollege-4339
Correct! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0GWD8Inuv-RyiJwcvKGQ3yx7ryV.0VN0EzNxwiN0AzNzEzW}
```

I showed my solve before.
My thought process: We understand how to use the tab command and see how tab completion is for more than files.
We can also tab-complete commands.
## What I learned
I learnt how to use the tab command to auto-complete commands.
