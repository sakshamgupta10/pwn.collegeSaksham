# Challenge Name: Matching with ?
In this challenge we will learn what ? is.
## My solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{QAk10jZEZ-RPv6K_tLBL7l7owhN.QXyIDO0wiN0AzNzEzW}'
```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /?ha??enge
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{QAk10jZEZ-RPv6K_tLBL7l7owhN.QXyIDO0wiN0AzNzEzW}
```

I showed my solve before.
My thought process: We understand how to use the ? glob and what it does.
We change the directory using cd but instead of c and l we use ?.

## What I learned
I learnt how to use the ? glob.
