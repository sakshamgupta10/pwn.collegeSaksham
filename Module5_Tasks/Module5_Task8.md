## My solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{o-MyYl6GmI9sTUqzpmr0BkQSxQB.0FN0EzNxwiN0AzNzEzW}'
```bash
hacker@globbing~tab-completion:~$ ls /challenge
DESCRIPTION.md  pwncollege​
hacker@globbing~tab-completion:~$ cat /challenge/pwncollege​
pwn.college{o-MyYl6GmI9sTUqzpmr0BkQSxQB.0FN0EzNxwiN0AzNzEzW}
```

I showed my solve before.
My thought process: We understand how to use the tab command.
If we hit tab in the shell, it'll try to figure out what we are going to type and automatically complete it.

## What I learned
I learnt how to use the tab command to auto-complete what we are doing.
