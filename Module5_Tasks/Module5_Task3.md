# Challenge Name: Matching with []
In this challenge we will learn what [] is.
## My solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{w2d5J-C5_2CiBhQHuMfraZoTXL-.QXzIDO0wiN0AzNzEzW}'
```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run file_[absh]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{w2d5J-C5_2CiBhQHuMfraZoTXL-.QXzIDO0wiN0AzNzEzW}
```

I showed my solve before.
My thought process: We understand how to use the [] glob and what it does.
The square brackets are, essentially, a limited form of ?, in that instead of matching any character, [] is a wildcard for some subset of potential characters, specified within the brackets.

## What I learned
I learnt how to use the [] glob and how it works.
