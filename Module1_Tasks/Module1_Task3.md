# Challenge Name: Command History
In this challenge we see that if we type a lot of commands, the shell saves a history of every command we invoke.
## My solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{4zv0ssmYYYgTPz2xnylVb0FBREP.0lNzEzNxwiN0AzNzEzW}'
```bash
$ history
    1  hello
    2  whoami
    3  echo Hello
    4  echo Hello Hackers!
    5  hello hackers
    6  hello hackers
    7  the flag is pwn.college{4zv0ssmYYYgTPz2xnylVb0FBREP.0lNzEzNxwiN0AzNzEzW}
```

I showed my solve before.
My thought process: I understood the use of the history command how it helps us save all the commands we have written before. As per me this is a very useful command as it helps us save a lot of time.
## What I learned
I learned how the history command is used and how it can help us save a lot of time. I also learnt that we can scroll through those saved commands with the up/down arrow keys.
