# Challenge Name: Intro to Commands 
In this challenge we invoke our first command and learn how to invoke the hello command to get the flag.

## My solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{Aa81z7Ok_5OTSR-mbzVcVmHE5Lk.QX3YjM1wiN0AzNzEzW}'
```bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Aa81z7Ok_5OTSR-mbzVcVmHE5Lk.QX3YjM1wiN0AzNzEzW}
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$
```

I showed my solve before.
My thought process: I understood everything for the 1st task from the video sent. I understood the use of whoami command and hello command. It was interesting to see how WSL and pwn.college linked together and were working.

## What I learned
I learned how to invoke commands. I also learnt the use of whoami and hello command. I also learnt that Linux is Case Sensitive.
