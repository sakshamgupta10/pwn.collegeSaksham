# Challenge Name: Implicit relative path
In this challenge we'll practice referring to paths using '.' a bit more.
## My solve
**Flag:** 'pwn.college{0n8sYEAQLYMgrCgicewGnh5b0VY.QXxUTN0wiN0AzNzEzW}'
```bash
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:~$ cd /challenge
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ ./run
Correct!!!
./run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0n8sYEAQLYMgrCgicewGnh5b0VY.QXxUTN0wiN0AzNzEzW}
```

I showed my solve before.
My thought process: I understood how to refer to paths using '.'x


## What I learned
I learnt implicit relative path and how to use '.' in paths.
